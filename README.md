# Batch healthy meals made and delivered from cloud kitchens:

I would like a bag full of meals delivered to my door every 2-3 days. Each meal should be individually packaged with ingredient and nutritional info.

The cost per meal should be <$10. Macros should be customizable within a range. Some suggested defaults (paleo, keto, etc.) should also be provided.

The meals should arrive cold and ready for storage in my fridge. I should have 2 days worth of meals at any given point.
